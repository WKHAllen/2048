# 2048

## Info

This is a version of the popular game 2048. While it's not very popular anymore, it's still extremely addicting.

The goal of the game is to reach the 2048 tile, which can be achieved by combining tiles with the same numbers. The largest achievable tile on a 4x4 grid is the 131072 tile, so I haven't properly colored any tiles after that one.

## Usage

The project makes use of electron, so to launch it one can run the following command:

```console
$ npm start
```

It can, however, be used without electron (i.e. in a standard webpage). All necessary items for use in a webpage are in /src/static
